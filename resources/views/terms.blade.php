                                        <li>Your attendance in a lesson is irrelevant to the issue of refunds. For the avoidance of doubt, this means that if You are unable to attend a lesson, this will still not guarantee You a refund if it is only notified within 12 hours of the start time.</li>
                                        <li>You may reschedule a lesson providing it is requested 12 hours prior to the start of the pre-arranged lesson.</li>

                                        <li>It is expected that You and Your Tutor discuss educational concerns with each other rather than with PT who are not educational providers in this contract.</li>
                                        <li>PT retain the absolute discretion to remove any feedback from a Tutor’s profile, or to add any feedback that a Tutor may have received elsewhere.</li>

                                        <li>You use the Site and services at Your own risk, acknowledge that You are making binding contracts with Your Clients, and that You must behave professionally, politely, and responsibly when dealing with Clients and pupils.</li>
                                        <li>You agree that PT will act as Your agent to agree and conclude contracts with Clients and to collect payments on Your behalf. For the avoidance of doubt, You accept that PT alone will be able to collect payments, on Your behalf, for the services that You provide through the Site.</li>
                                        <li>You will provide PT with the correct details of a UK current account that is in Your name for PT to transfer Your payments to.</li>
                                        <li>You will provide tuition through the Site to the best of Your ability. You will provide all of the content for the sessions and You will plan them in advance so that You provide an excellent and professional service.</li>

                                        <li>If You become unable to deliver on Your commitments, contractual or otherwise, for any reason You undertake to ensure that Your client is made aware immediately. If this is not possible, You agree to contact PT via phone to request that PT make Your client aware.</li>
                                        <li>Never act in a way that might make PT look bad or bring PT into disrepute.</li>
                                        <li>In the event that any of these commitments are not met, You are deemed to intend to refund the client. Thus, PT may issue a refund in that situation on Your behalf without Your express permission. For the avoidance of doubt, being unable to effectively communicate (a standard that PT reserves the discretion to assess) due to poor microphone quality will be deemed an event that PT may issue a refund on Your behalf for.</li>
                                        <li>You agree to ensure that any information that You provide to PT and/or Your client is accurate and up to date at all times. If Your circumstances change, You must notify PT at the soonest possible date.</li>

                                    <ul>
                                        <li>The cost of one tutorial (the “Fee”) is agreed in advance through the applicable section of the Site when logged into Your account. Setting a price means that You agree to deliver tutorials at that price and agree with PT’s commission that PT retain.</li>
                                        <li>Payments from clients may be made in any form and You are deemed to authorise PT and/or its agents to accept payment in any form.</li>
                                        <li>The Fee is to be held by PT until the next payment date is due whereupon PT will pay the Tutor the Fee, minus PT’s commission and, when applicable, VAT.</li>
                                        <li>You have the right to adjust the Fee that You wish to charge and may do so at any time. When You adjust Your Fee, all new clients will be charged the new Fee. Existing clients will continue to be charged at their original Fee unless You adjust the Fee for them individually.</li>
                                        <li>You must be self-employed and not pay VAT. You are solely responsible to HMRC for all of Your relevant tax and NICs. As such, PT are indemnified by You for all demands from HMRC (including penalties or interest) due to Your failure to account accurately. This includes expenses, costs, legal fees and any other costs that PT sustain in dealing with a claim brought by You or anyone else in relation to You.</li>
                                        <li>Evidently, You are not an employee of PT and nothing in these terms or otherwise constitutes a contract of employment between PT and You. You fully indemnify PT against any liability or claim relating to the service You provide on the Site. This includes expenses, costs, legal fees and any other costs that PT sustain in dealing with a claim brought by You or anyone else in relation to You.</li>
                                        <li>Your funds are released to Your account by PT on a bi-monthly basis. In the event of a dispute regarding a payment, PT may retain the funds until the dispute has been resolved.</li>
                                        <li>For the avoidance of doubt, PT may issue refunds in accordance with clauses 4.9. and 4.10.</li>
                                        <li>PT is entitled to offset amounts payable to make up for refunds issued if required.</li>
                                        <li>You authorise PT to self-bill by retaining the commission and, when relevant, VAT prior to payment to You.</li>
                                        <li>You are responsible for chargebacks and refunds (except in the events outlined in 4.9. and 4.10.) and indemnify PT for any losses resulting from this.</li>
                                        <li>PT will make the payments to You for the monies You are owed by BACS to the current account details that You provided. It is crucial that You provide the correct details as You may not be paid if they are incorrect. In the event that PT suspect the details are incorrect they may (though are not obliged to) delay Your payment in order to contact You and ensure that the details are accurate.</li>
                                        <li>In the event of a late payment by either party, interest may accrue 10 days after the issue is made known. For the avoidance of doubt, this is not from the date the monies were owed, but 10 days after the issue is raised in writing via email. The interest rate is the base rate per annum plus 2%.</li>
                                        <li>PT may issue clients with deals and discounts. This will not reduce Your take-home payment as it will come solely out of PT’s commission unless expressly agreed otherwise with You.</li>
                                        <li>In the event that You breach the terms by taking a client that You first made contact with through the Site, off the Site, PT are entitled to claim from You an estimation of the damage that PT sustained from Your breach of contract. This shall be calculated based on weekly lessons for two school terms at the Fee the client saw on Your profile when You first engaged with them.</li>
