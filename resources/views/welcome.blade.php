		  We would love to set up a meeting with a member of your Senior

		  <h3>Achievement</h3>
		  <p>
			Evidence shows that pupils improve in both their exam
			performance and engagement with education by undertaking a
			course of tuition. In fact, pupil progress over a 10-week course
			can bump a pupil up a whole grade or even more!
		  </p>
		  <p>
			If your school is a stickler for statistics, a member of the
			Progressio Tuition team will always be happy to run you through
			some of the incredible evidence and case studies of pupil
			improvement as a result of Progressio Tuition’s great tutors.
			Here is an example:
		  </p>
		  <p class="p-txt">
			“Ella* was in Year 11 and still struggling to get the marks she
			knew that she was capable of achieving in Maths. Ella was
			intelligent but struggled to remember all of the methods so was
			working at a B grade. Ella joined her Progressio Tutor for a
			12-week course of maths sessions that helped her to revise and
			develop her maths skills further. After sitting the papers, Ella
			came out with two A* graded papers and an A* overall! Ella said
			that without her tutor, she never would have felt as confident
			before, during, and even after the exam”

		<div class="achive-heading">
		  <h3>24/7 Support</h3>
		  <p>
			Progressio Tuition is a whole package service, not a tutor
			matching service. We will work with Schools, Tutors, parents and
			pupils at any time to guarantee you the best possible results.
			Our founder has committed to personally responding to any issues
			and we will be happy to take your call whenever it comes in, be
			that during school hours, weekends or holidays.

	  <div class="col-md-6">
		<div class="achive-heading">
		  <h3>Cost</h3>
		  <p>
			We know that budgets are tight in education, so we do our
			absolute best to work with Schools to create the most
			cost-effective plan we possibly can in order to fit your needs.
			There are multiple ways that Schools can make use of smaller
			budgets and we are always more than happy to make
			recommendations and tailor School specific plans to cater for
			you.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			Additionally, we try to build relationships with businesses to
			encourage investment in our country’s future. As such, we do our
			best to subsidise the cost for Schools as far as we can to
			ensure that all can pupils have access to this life-changing
			resource
		  </p>
		</div>
		<div class="achive-heading">
		  <h3>Analysis</h3>
		  <p>
			At Progressio Tuition we believe in evidence-based progression.
			That is why we compile an extensive Impact Assessment for your
			School records that analyses progress from both a
			statistical/quantitative perspective that draws on grade and
			test data, and from a qualitative perspective that draws on the
			written assessments from teachers and tutors throughout the
			year. To make it even easier, we will always be sure to provide
			a concise but thorough summary at the start so that Teachers,
			Parents and Governors are easily able to access the headline
			points. Further, we recommend discussing the findings with the
			Senior Leadership Team and Governors so that we can foster a
			relationship of progressive collaboration with your School.
